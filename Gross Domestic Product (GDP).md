Gross Domestic Product (GDP): 
- definition 1: the total value of all final goods and services produce in an 
economy in year
– definition 2: GDP may be defined as the total of all economic activity in a 
country, regardless of who owns the productive assets

There are different methods that are used to calculate this figure
- the output method
+ this measures the actual output of the goods and services produced
+ this is calculated by summing all of the value added by all the firms in 
an economy
+ when we say “value added” it means that at each stage of a 
production process we deduct the costs of inputs, so as to not double 
count
+ the data is usually grouped according to the different sectors in the 
economy, primary, secondary, and tertiary
- the income method
– this measures the value of all the incomes earned in an economy
- the expenditure method:
+ this measures the value of all spending on goods and services in the 
economy
+ this is calculated by summing up the spending by all different sectors in 
the economy
GDP = C + I + G + (X – M)
C = Consumption
the total spending by households on goods and services
I = Investment
the total spending to create new things (economic activities,...)
G = Government spending
the spending government does on public goods
(X – M) = Exports minus imports
the spending of foreigners on goods produced by our country (exports) minus the 
spending domestic consumers make on goods produced abroad (imports)
it doesn’t matter: regardless the method chosen, in theory, accounting will result 
in the same final figure, whether we call it national output, 
national income, or national expenditure
national output = national income = national expenditure
(the IB uses the expenditure method)

nominal GDP and real GDP
• nominal GDP
– measures the value of a nation’s output produced in a year, expressed 
in the value of the prices charged for that particular year
– does not take into account inflation
• real GDP
– the value of a nation’s output in a particular year adjusted for changes 
in the price level from a base year.
– this offers a more accurate measure of the actual quantity of goods and 
services a nation produces because it adjusts for price changes
real GDP is a better indicator of output than nominal GDP. So it is going to be what we're going to use going forward
• GDP per capita
– measures the total GDP of a nation divided by the total 
population
– this gives a more realistic measure of how rich a nation is
key takeaways on GDP
• why GDP is important

– GDP per capita is a better indicator of the well-being of a typical 
person in a nation than total GDP
• shortcomings of GDP
– it ignores all social aspects of life
– certain work is not accounted for
– fewer working hours
– does not include hidden markets
– does not account for degradation of environment
– does not take into account equity
GDP is the aggregate demand in a nation
