Gross Domestic Product (GDP): 
- definition 1: the total value of all final goods and services produce in an 
economy in year
– definition 2: GDP may be defined as the total of all economic activity in a 
country, regardless of who owns the productive assets

There are different methods that are used to calculate this figure
- the output method
+ this measures the actual output of the goods and services produced
+ this is calculated by summing all of the value added by all the firms in 
an economy
+ when we say “value added” it means that at each stage of a 
production process we deduct the costs of inputs, so as to not double 
count
+ the data is usually grouped according to the different sectors in the 
economy, primary, secondary, and tertiary
- the income method
– this measures the value of all the incomes earned in an economy
- the expenditure method:
+ this measures the value of all spending on goods and services in the 
economy
+ this is calculated by summing up the spending by all different sectors in 
the economy
GDP = C + I + G + (X – M)
C = Consumption
the total spending by households on goods and services
I = Investment
the total spending to create new things (economic activities,...)
G = Government spending
the spending government does on public goods
(X – M) = Exports minus imports
the spending of foreigners on goods produced by our country (exports) minus the 
spending domestic consumers make on goods produced abroad (imports)
it doesn’t matter: regardless the method chosen, in theory, accounting will result 
in the same final figure, whether we call it national output, 
national income, or national expenditure
national output = national income = national expenditure
(the IB uses the expenditure method)

nominal GDP and real GDP
• nominal GDP
– measures the value of a nation’s output produced in a year, expressed 
in the value of the prices charged for that particular year
– does not take into account inflation
• real GDP
– the value of a nation’s output in a particular year adjusted for changes 
in the price level from a base year.
– this offers a more accurate measure of the actual quantity of goods and 
services a nation produces because it adjusts for price changes
real GDP is a better indicator of output than nominal GDP. So it is going to be what we're going to use going forward
• GDP per capita
– measures the total GDP of a nation divided by the total 
population
– this gives a more realistic measure of how rich a nation is
key takeaways on GDP
• why GDP is important

– GDP per capita is a better indicator of the well-being of a typical 
person in a nation than total GDP
• shortcomings of GDP
– it ignores all social aspects of life
– certain work is not accounted for
– fewer working hours
– does not include hidden markets
– does not account for degradation of environment
– does not take into account equity
GDP is the aggregate demand in a nation
Definition: green GDP is a measure of GDP that takes into account any 
environmental costs incurred from the production of the goods and 
services included in GDP figures
• equation: green GDP = GDP – environmental costs of production
• the environmental costs of production may include costs such as health, 
agricultural, and industrial costs caused by air pollution and water 
pollution
• they may also include the costs of waste disposal and the costs of clearing 
up any environmental damage

why are national 
incomes statistics 
gathered?
 compiling this data is extremely complicated and expensive
• every country has an organization that is responsible for calculating and reporting 
on the country’s national accounts
• the United Nations provides guidelines for such work—the System of National 
Accounts (SNA)
• uses for national income statistics
– can be used as a “report card” for countries—a measure of economic growth
– to develop government policies for countries
– economists use data to develop models and forecasts about future
– businesses use data to make forecasts about future demand
– to analyze the performance of a country over time
– to evaluate the standard of living of a country—because rising incomes 
accounts as a basis for the quality of life in a country
– to compare different countries
limitations on national 
income data
• inaccuracies 
– the data are used to calculate the various measures of national 
income come from a vastly wide range of sources, including tax 
claims by households, firms, output data, and sales data
– lag time: figures tend to be more accurate over time
– more developed countries can be assumed to be reliable: because in developed countries, most of the transactions happen electronically as opposed to in cash.
• unreported or under-recorded economic activity—informal markets
– important to note that national income data accounts can only record 
economic activity that has been officially recorded
– therefore, it doesn’t include do-it-yourself work or work done at home
– only “paid work” is recorded
– this is most significant in developing countries where much of the output does 
not make it to any recorded market
• food consumption from home
• poverty driven home fixes
– hidden economy 
• definition: economic activity that goes unrecorded or under-recorded
• examples: illegal activities, drug trafficking, payments to illegal immigrants, 
underreporting of income in high income tax countries, high indirect taxes, 
government health and safety standards

– UN SNA works with countries to improve data collection
• external costs
– GDP does not take into account the costs of resource depletion
– example: cutting down trees leads to an increase of GDP, but 
there is no measure to account for the loss of these trees
– GDP figures do not make deductions for the negative 
consequences of air and water pollution and traffic congestion, 
as these are external costs
– these external costs will compromise quality of life, even as 
GDP rises
• other quality of life concerns
– GDP may grow even as people are working longer hours, or taking 
fewer holidays
– GDP accounting does not include free activities such as volunteer work 
or people caring for the elderly and children at home
– these activities lead to a better society, but might even be discouraged 
in pursuit of economic growth
"the richer you get doesn't necessarily mean the happier you get"
• composition of output
– it is possible that a large part of a country’s output is in goods that do 
not benefit consumers, such as defense goods or capital goods
"the richer you get doesn't necessarily mean the happier you get"
