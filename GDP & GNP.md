We are going to focus on the D and the N.

OK, so gross domestic product, gross domestic product is talking about domestic.

That means the house where the economic activity is happening.

So if you want to know the gross domestic product, then you just look at a map and you see gelee and

you go, OK, gross domestic product is all of the economic activity that's going on in that geographic

location, regardless of where the money ends up afterward.

It's just a calculation of all economic activity in a particular geographic or domestic place.

GDP: gross domestic product
– definition: GDP may be defined as the total of all economic activity in 
a country, regardless of who owns the productive assets
– example: Nike (MNC) working in China counts for China’s GDP not US’s
*GDP has to do with the physical location!

GNP: gross national product or gross national income (GNI)
• definition: the total income that is earned by a country’s factors of production 
regardless of where the assets are located
• example: Nike’s profits would now count for US not China’s since a US company 
actually owns the assets
• GNP is equal to GDP plus income earned from assets abroad minus income paid to 
foreign assets operating domestically
• property income from abroad: income earned by assets held in foreign countries
• net property income from abroad: the difference between income earned from 
assets abroad minus income paid to foreign assets operating domestically
• equation: GNP = GDP + net property income from abroad
