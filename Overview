**The government has four main economic goals:
1. economic growth
2. low level of unemployment (5%)
3. low and stable rate if inflation (2%)
4. equitable distribution of income
1. level of overall economic activity
- Add all of microeconomic stuff that created this macro
- one of the main mechanisms we are going to use in order to study the health of the economy is something called gross domestic product (GDP).
Gross domestic product is simply a measure of all economic activity that's happening in a country in a given period of time and the level of overall economic activity, GDP will tell you things
about the other major macroeconomic goals, like a low and stable rate of inflation, a low level of
unemployment and equity in the distribution of income.
-> From there, all of these government policies and situations play out
2. aggregate demand and aggregate supply
Aggregate supply and aggregate demand also mean total supply and total demand
this means that all consumers and all producers in all markets are expressed in one diagram, and that is the aggregate supply aggregate demand diagram
The aggregate demand aggregate supply diagram is going to be the starting point of our studies of understanding how it is we we measure economic growth, how it is that we measure low and stable rate of inflation, how it is that we measure low unemployment.

they can’t get them
• goal: 5% unemployment rate
